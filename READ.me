Drum Kit Project
Overview
This project is a simple drum kit application that allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing keyboard keys. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Files
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure and buttons for the drum kit.
index.js: The JavaScript file handling the functionality of the drum kit.
styles.css: (Assumed) The CSS file for styling the drum kit.
Setup Instructions
Download the Project Files

Ensure you have downloaded or cloned the following files:

index.html
index.js
styles.css (if applicable)
Sound files located in the sounds directory
Check File Paths

Verify that the paths to the JavaScript file and sound files in your HTML and JavaScript files are correct.

JavaScript Path:

Open index.html and ensure the path to index.js is correct. The script tag in index.html should look like this:

html
Copy code
<script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
If index.js is in the same directory as index.html, the path is correct. If it's in a different directory, update the path accordingly.

Sound Files Path:

In index.js, make sure the paths to the sound files are correct. For example:

javascript
Copy code
case "w":
    var audio = new Audio("sounds/crash.mp3");
    audio.play();
    break;
Ensure the sounds directory contains the following files:

crash.mp3
kick-bass.mp3
snare.mp3
tom-1.mp3
tom-2.mp3
tom-3.mp3
tom-4.mp3
Open the HTML File

Open index.html in a web browser to view and interact with the drum kit.

Troubleshooting
JavaScript Not Loading: If the JavaScript functionality is not working, check the browser's developer console for errors. Ensure that the path to index.js is correct and that the file exists at the specified location.

Sound Files Not Playing: If sounds are not playing, ensure that the sound files are correctly placed in the sounds directory and that the paths in index.js match the actual location of the files.
